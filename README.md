# assign-to-repository-projects
Github Action assigning pull requests to GitHub projects of a repository.

Instead of checking in `node_modules` for the [JavaScript action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action)
we are using [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc). To build the project run `npm run build`.
